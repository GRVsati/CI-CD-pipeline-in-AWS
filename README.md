## Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline utilizing AWS services. When a JSON file is inserted into an S3 bucket, it triggers an AWS Lambda function. Subsequently, the AWS CodeBuild pipeline is initiated. The Lambda function filters the JSON content and stores it in another S3 bucket.
